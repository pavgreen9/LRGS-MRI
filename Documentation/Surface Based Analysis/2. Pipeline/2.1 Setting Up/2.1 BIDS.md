# What is BIDS 
Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) (Gorgolewski et al., 2016) is basically a file arrangement system for neuroimaging e.g., MRI, fMRI, EEG etc. The main benefit of having it arranged as such as that it allows for a more streamlined output and navigation, and transparency. This makes it conducive for large scale projects and collaborations. 

But the main reason why we're interested in BIDS is because some pipelines just won't work without it as it requires BIDS formatted files for input and output. 

## How to BIDS
## 1. Add .dcm extension
```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# DCM Extension ## Extract file from folder
wd='/home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/unprocessed_raws' 
cd $wd 
ls | grep -P "(^9\d{3}|^A\d{3})" > subjList.txt 

## Loop through each subject and create subject directory 
for sub in $(cat subjList.txt); do 
	subdir=$wd/$sub 
	
	## Check if the number of files in the folder is less than 5 
	if [[ $(ls $subdir | wc -l) -lt 5 && "$(ls $subdir)" != *'mprage'* ]]; then
	
		## Loop through the file in the folder 
		for subfile in $(ls $subdir); do
			imgfile=$subdir/$subfile 
		
			## Loop through the subfile, move img to subdir 
			for img in $(ls $imgfile); do 
				imgpath=$imgfile/$img 
				mv $imgpath $subdir 
			 
			done 
			rm -rf $imgfile
		done 
	fi 
	
	# Add .dcm extension 
	for img in $(ls $subdir); do 
		if [[ "$img" != *.dcm && "$(ls $subdir)" != *'mprage'* ]]; then
			src=$subdir/$img 
			dst=$subdir/$img.dcm 
			mv $src $dst 
			
		fi 
	done 
done
```

The long and short of the both codes is that it

1.  It checks if there are less than 5 files in the participant folder that you would download from Teams
	1. If there are more than 5 files, it automatically assumes those are `img` files
	2. If there are less than 5 files and `mprage` is not in the list of files, it automatically assumes those are `subfiles` that contain the `img` files
2.  Assuming `1.2` it will then loop through each of the `subfile` and move them to the parent folder i.e. directly out in the open
3.  After looping, it will then delete the `subfile` (which are empty anyways after moving the `img` files) to ensure that only `imgfiles` remain in each participant folder
4.  Then it will check if the `imgfiles` in the participant folder contain a `.dcm` extension and if there isn’t `mprage` there - if no it adds

The code allows for the addition of `.dcm` to `img` files that don’t already have them and ignore those that already have `.dcm` or have been processed to `.nii`.

The assumptions are:

1.  If more than 5 sub-directory in participant folder and no `mprage` - then the files are `img` files
    1.  May consider adding a line or two that will confirm whether the files are sub-directories but I feel that it might be redundant
2.  The sub-directories in a participant folder will immediately contain the `img` files and the existence of `mprage` assumes that the `img` files have been processed to `.nii`
    1.  Can also be addressed but considering how uniform the structure has been, assume this to be a non-issue
3.  Participant folder will always either contain
    1.  Sub-directories containing `img` files or
    2.  `img` files themselves

## 2. BIDSify Everything

BIDS requires a .nii.gz format of the T1w image and formatting it correctly. If it sounds like a headache its because it is.

[`dcm2bids`](https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/) is a good resource to just get your dependencies sorted, and I've tailored this part of the documentation so that it fits our purposes and use case. 

### Activate the conda environment
```bash
conda activate {env}
```

### Create your directory
```bash
cd /home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants
mkdir dcmraws
```

### Scaffolding
```bash
dcm2bids_scaffold -o ./dcmraws
cd dcmraws
```

```bash
### View your scaffold
tree .

### Output
└── dcmraws
    ├── CHANGES
    ├── code
    ├── dataset_description.json
    ├── derivatives
    ├── participants.json
    ├── participants.tsv
    ├── README
    └── sourcedata

4 directories, 5 files
```

### Move your raw files to sourcedata
```bash
#!/bin/bash 

wd='/home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/unprocessed_raws'
cd $wd
ls | grep -P "(^9\d{3}|^A\d{3})" > subjList.txt 
while read participant; do
	mv ${participant} ../dcmraws/sourcedata/${participant}
done < subjList.txt 
```

### Create a .json file and place it in `code` directory
```javascript
{
  "descriptions": [
  	{
  		"dataType": "anat",
  		"modalityLabel": "T1w",
  		"criteria": {
  			"MRAcquisitionType": "3D"
  			}
  		}
	]
}
```

### Create a file to store BIDS Output
```bash
mkdir /home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/BIDSout
```

### Run dc2bids 
```bash
wd='/home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/dcmraws'
od='/home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/BIDSout'
cd ${wd}/sourcedata
ls | grep -P "(^9\d{3}|^A\d{3})" > subjList.txt 

# Remember to check logs and tmp files for errors after this
while read participant; do
	if [ -d "${od}/sub-${participant}" ]; then
		pass
	else
		cd ${wd}/sourcedata/${participant}
		dcm2bids -d . -p ${participant} \
		-c ${wd}/code/dcm2bids_config.json \
