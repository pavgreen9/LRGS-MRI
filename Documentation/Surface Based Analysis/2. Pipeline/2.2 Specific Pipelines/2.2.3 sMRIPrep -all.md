_sMRIPrep_ is a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data preprocessing pipeline that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is robust to variations in scan acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive error and output reporting. It performs basic processing steps (subject-wise averaging, B1 field correction, spatial normalization, segmentation, skullstripping etc.) providing outputs that can be easily connected to subsequent tools such as [fMRIPrep](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep) or [dMRIPrep](https://github.com/nipreps/dmriprep).

If it looks confusing you're not alone. But this is to emphasise the complicated and interconnected preprocessing steps of sMRIPrep, half of which I have no literacy on.  

The built in freesurfer entails some custom code which corrects for their previously done registration and INU correction, as mentioned in their paper ([Esteban et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4)). In other words, we can't just chuck in the sMRIPrep-only image into free/fastsurfer. Although the results in [[2.2.4 sMRIPrep(only) - fastsurfer]] were surprisingly coherent. 

#### Preprocessing anatomical images
**The T1w image is** **corrected for intensity nonuniformity with N4BiasFieldCorrection**[91](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR91 "Tustison, N. J. et al. N4ITK: improved N3 bias correction. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 29, 1310–1320 (2010).") (ANTs) and skull-stripped with antsBrainExtraction.sh (ANTs). Skull-stripping is done through co-registration to a template, with two options available: the OASIS template[92](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR92 "Marcus, D. S. et al. Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 19, 1498–1507 (2007).") (default) and the NKI template[93](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR93 "Nooner, K. B. et al. The NKI-Rockland sample: a model for accelerating the pace of discovery science in psychiatry. Front. Neurosci. 6, 152 (2012)."). Using visual inspection, we have found that this approach outperforms other common approaches, which is in agreement with previous reports[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR26 "Glasser, M. F. et al. The minimal preprocessing pipelines for the Human Connectome Project. Neuroimage 80, 105–124 (2013)."). **When several T1w volumes are found, the intensity-nonuniformity-corrected versions are first fused into a reference T1w map of the subject with mri_robust_template**[94](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR94 "Reuter, M., Rosas, H. D. & Fischl, B. Highly accurate inverse consistent registration: a robust approach. Neuroimage 53, 1181–1196 (2010).") (FreeSurfer). Brain surfaces are reconstructed from the subject’s T1w reference (and T2w images if available) with recon-all[95](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR95 "Dale, A. M., Fischl, B. & Sereno, M. I. Cortical surface-based analysis. I. Segmentation and surface reconstruction. Neuroimage 9, 179–194 (1999).") (FreeSurfer). The brain mask estimated previously is refined with a **custom variation of a method** (originally introduced in Mindboggle[96](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR96 "Klein, A. et al. Mindboggling morphometry of human brains. PLoS Comput. Biol. 13, e1005350 (2017).")) **to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray matter (GM)**. Both surface reconstruction and subsequent mask refinement are optional and can be disabled to save run time when surface-based analysis is not needed. Spatial normalization to the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template[97](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR97 "Fonov, V., Evans, A., McKinstry, R., Almli, C. & Collins, D. Unbiased nonlinear average age-appropriate brain templates from birth to adulthood. Neuroimage 47, S102 (2009).") (version 2009c) is done through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration[98](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR98 "Avants, B. B., Epstein, C. L., Grossman, M. & Gee, J. C. Symmetric diffeomorphic image registration with cross-correlation: evaluating automated labeling of elderly and neurodegenerative brain. Med. Image. Anal. 12, 26–41 (2008).") (ANTs), using brain-extracted versions of both the T1w reference and the standard template. ANTs was selected because of its superior performance in terms of volumetric group level overlap[99](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR99 "Klein, A. et al. Evaluation of 14 nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to human brain MRI registration. Neuroimage 46, 786–802 (2009)."). Brain tissues—cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and GM—are segmented from the reference, brain-extracted T1w image with FAST[100](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4#ref-CR100 "Zhang, Y., Brady, M. & Smith, S. Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 20, 45–57 (2001).") (FSL).

![[Pasted image 20230227040900.png]]

## SynthStrip -> sMRIPrep 1mm
**SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> sMRIPrep** at 1mm.

## SynthStrip -> sMRIPrep 0.7mm
**SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> sMRIPrep** at 0.7mm.

## SynthStrip -> Nibabel-Downsample -> sMRIPrep 1mm
**SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> sMRIPrep** at 1mm.

## SynthStrip -> Nibabel-Downsample -> sMRIPrep 0.7mm
**SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> sMRIPrep** at 0.7mm.

## Notes on Output

### Resolution
- Similar to freesurfer's but the T1w has better contrast due to its INU correction. 

### Brainmask
- Weird elongation of grey matter at the top and squashed grey matter at the bottom
- Noticeable - but minor distortion between T1w and brainmask

### Surface-based Segmentation
- Quite okay - slightly more lenient than its [[2.2.4 sMRIPrep(only) - fastsurfer]] output

### Performance
1. **Original** **1mm** 1.5-2 hours per participant

## Future Considerations
- Due to the insane number of permutations - I've decided to narrow down the sequence to **skullstrip -> preprocess** as literature often highlights its effectiveness
1. Might be worth considering running the SynthStrip output at 1mm and 0.7mm - assuming SynthStrip
	1. At 1mm we could compare
		1. **SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> fastsurfer**
		2. **SynthStrip -> fastsurfer**
	2. At 0.7mm we could compare
		1. **SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsample -> fastsurfer** 
		2. 2. **SynthStrip -> fastsurfer**
