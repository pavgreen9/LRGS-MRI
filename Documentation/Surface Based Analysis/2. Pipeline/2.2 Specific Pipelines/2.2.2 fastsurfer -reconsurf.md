Taken from [directory](https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer) :
FastSurfer - a fast and accurate deep-learning based neuroimaging pipeline. This approach provides a full [FreeSurfer](https://freesurfer.net/) alternative for volumetric analysis (within 1 minute) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1h run time). The whole pipeline consists of two main parts:

1. FastSurferCNN/VINN - an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole brain segmentation into 95 classes in under 1 minute, mimicking FreeSurferâ€™s anatomical segmentation and cortical parcellation (DKTatlas)

2. recon-surf - full FreeSurfer alternative for cortical surface reconstruction, mapping of cortical labels and traditional point-wise and ROI thickness analysis in approximately 60 minutes. For surface group analysis, sphere.reg is also generated automatically by default. To safe time, this can be turned off with the `--no_surfreg` flag.

Image input requirements are identical to FreeSurfer: good quality T1-weighted MRI acquired at 3T with a resolution between **1mm and 0.7mm isotropic** (slice thickness should not exceed 1.5mm). Preferred sequence is Siemens MPRAGE or multi-echo MPRAGE. GE SPGR should also work. Sub-mm scans (e.g. .75 or .8mm isotropic) will be conformed to the highest resolution (smallest per-direction voxel size). This behaviour can be changed with the `--vox_size` flag.

### Running code

```bash
while read participant; do
	nohup docker run --gpus all \
		-v /home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/${participant}/mprage/anat:/data \
		-v /home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/${participant}/PS2:/output \
		-v /usr/local/freesurfer/7.3.2:/fs_license \
		--rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) deepmi/fastsurfer:latest \
		--fs_license /fs_license/license.txt \
		--t1 /data/${file}.nii \
		--sid ${file}_${mm} --sd /output \
		--parallel \
		--threads 12 \
		--vox_size ${mm}
	sleep 90S
done < subjlist.txt

```

Use this to check the progress in another terminal
```bash
tail -f nohup.out
```

## Notes
1. My GPU can only run one participant at a time at 0.7mm, with each participant taking 1.2 hours to preprocess - hence the code
2. Edit the threads as necessary
3. The requirements specified are **1mm and 0.7mm isotropic** which we clearly do not have as our data is, though it is automatically downsampled and isometricised

```bash
dimensions: 176 x 512 x 512
voxel sizes: 1.000000, 0.468800, 0.468800
```

## Notes on Output

### Resolution
- 0.7mm resolution is much clearer

### Brainmask
- Fastsurfer does a very good job at skull-stripping - preliminary visual inspection shows very little differences between the **SynthStripped -> fast** and **fastsurfer-only** versions
	- Surprisingly, fastsurfer on its own does a better job at skullstripping than SynthStrip
	- Generally speaking it appears that the **fastsurfer-only** version is slightly more aggressive than the **Synth+fastsurfer-stripped** version - both in a good and bad way
- Higher resolutions end up in slightly cleaner brain masks but nothing to be bothered by

### Surface-based Segmentation
- **Original** **1mm** is more lenient in segmenting than **0.7mm** images
- **SynthStripped** ones are more lenient than **fastsurfer-only-stripped** counterparts

### Performance
1. **Original** **1mm** 0.5 hours per participant
2. **SynthStripped->fastsurfer** at .7mm takes up ~1.5 hours per participant

## Future Considerations
- Due to the insane number of permutations - I've decided to narrow down the sequence to skullstrip -> preprocess as literature often highlights its effectiveness
1. Might be worth considering running the SynthStrip output at 1mm and 0.7mm - assuming SynthStrip
	1. At 1mm we could compare
		1. **SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsampling -> fastsurfer**
	3. At 0.7mm we could compare
		2. **SynthStrip -> nibabel-downsample -> fastsurfer**
