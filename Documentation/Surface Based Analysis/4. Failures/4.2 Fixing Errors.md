# SkullStripping Error

Check the `pial` surface and consider whether too much or too little cortex was accounted for. If the pial surface also accounts for the skull’s dura matter or even the skull itself, the thickness and volume measurements will be inflated.

> Even if not all skull/dura matter were removed, it's fine as long as the pial surface does not trace over them

## Set Watershed Threshold

You can control the aggressiveness of the skull stripping by setting the watershed threshold - 0 to 50; default is 25. Increasing will make it more lenient, conversely decreasing will increase its aggressiveness.

This is an example of a bad skull strip

You can remove with this

```bash
recon-all -skullstrip -wsthresh 5 -clean-bm -s {original T1.nii}
```

Then run it through recon-all again

## Using -gcut

Even with a lower watershed threshold, there are still bits of skull and dura mater that remain. You can use the -gcut option to remove the latter:

```bash
recon-all -skullstrip -clean-bm -gcut -s {original T1.nii}
```

But you might get an error

```bash
** Gcutted brain is much smaller than the mask!
** Using the mask as the output instead!
```

This is because too much of the brain has been removed. in cases like these, you can’t do anything.

In cases where it does work, load these in `freeview`

```bash
freeview -f mri/brainmask.mgz mri/T1.mgz mri/brainmask.gcuts.mgz:colormap=LUT
```

This will display the excised regions in fuschia; use the overlay slider to examine where the dura excision may have cut into the cortex, such as in the frontal area.

# Pial Surface Errors

A related problem is an inaccurate pial surface, which can be caused by failures in skull-stripping or removal of dura mater - removal of cortex. A more accurate method is to manually remove those parts of the surface which trace parts of the nearby skull or dura mater.

```bash
freeview -v mri/brainmask.mgz -f surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=red surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=red surf/lh.white:edgecolor=yellow surf/rh.white:edgecolor=yellow
```

In this case, we can remove these voxels using the `recon edit` tool, the icon in the upper left which shows the outline of a head with an “R” written on it.

Make sure that the `brainmask` volume is highlighted in the sidebar, and then click on the Recon Edit button and make sure that the `recon editing` box is checked. In the viewing pane, zoom in on the pial surface that contains skull, hold down the shift key, and then click and drag to remove any voxels that have been misclassified as pial surface.

> Although it can be difficult at times to determine what is skull and what is cortex, usually the voxels of the skull are slightly brighter than their neighbors. Be conservative with your edits, and judge whether the new outline is more anatomically correct than the previous one.

After you’re finished, rerun recon-all

# Control Points and Intensity Normalisation

During preprocessing, FreeSurfer will perform a step called **intensity normalization**. This refers to a homogenization of the signal intensity of the white and grey matter, in order to better distinguish between the tissue types and make it easier to segment the brain.

Intensity normalization failures are typically indicated by an inaccurate white matter surface. We can solve this by adding **control points** to specify which parts of cortex should be classified as white matter. These control points act like tiny lamps that illuminate their immediate surroundings; by increasing the signal intensity of nearby voxels, they increase the likelihood that the area will be classified as white matter.

## Identifying Intensity Normalisation Errors and Setting Control Points

Intensity normalization errors usually occur in areas that are susceptible to signal dropout - such as the **ventral frontal cortex** and **ventral areas of the temporal lobe**.

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230227153438.png)
You can add a control point by clicking with the left mouse button on voxels that seem to belong to the white matter, but which aren’t encapsulated by the white matter surface.

Be sparing with your placement of control points: **do not place them inside the yellow line, and do not place them in voxels that are clearly grey matter**. Just two or three are enough to cover a moderate-sized area. Remember that they will extend their influence to nearby voxels as well.

If you need to remove a control point, you can either undo it by pressing `cmd+z`, or by holding `Shift` and left-clicking on the control point you want to remove.

For other considerations of where to set control points, see the [FreeSurfer intensity normalization tutorial](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/ControlPointsV6.0)

When you are done setting the control points, click on `File -> Save Point Set`, and save the file as `control.dat` in the subject’s `tmp` directory. Then close `freeview` and type the following from the subject directory:

```bash
recon-all -autorecon2-cp -autorecon3 -s {subid}
```
