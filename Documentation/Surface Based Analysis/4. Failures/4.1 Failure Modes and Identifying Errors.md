There will be small discrepancies between the segmented areas and the actual T1 images. If they are small and infrequent then its best to leave them alone. Fixing them may cause more problems than damage.

In cases where recon-all fails to complete for some subjects/exits prematurely, there will be large discrepancies that require manual edits. For example, there may be holes on the matter surfaces, which can throw off calculations of thickness and volume. These may require manual edits.

## Hard vs Soft Failures

### Hard Failures

**Hard failures** are caused by:

1.  No write permission to the current disk (to fix this, see the help file for the `chmod` command);
2.  Insufficient disk space; or
3.  Problems with the anatomical image, such as too much motion.

You can resolve scenarios 1 and 2 easily. For 3, you will need to make sure the subject is still during anatomical scan and check the slices as they are acquired.

### Soft Failures

****************************Soft failures**************************** are caused by:

1.  Skullstripping errors;
2.  Pial surface errors;
3.  Intensity normalization errors;
4.  Topological defects; and
5.  White matter segmentation errors.

They occur when no error outputs are there when there are obvious errors that need to be fixed e.g., Large holes in white matter and large discrepancies between the border of the white and grey matter of the anatomical volume and reconstructed surface

**Topological defects** refer to either holes that are punched through the reconstructed white matter surface, or to false “handles” of grey matter that bridge gyri. These will appear in the white matter surfaces in the `surf` directory. Since the release of FreeSurfer version 6.0 these types of errors are very rare, and they are usually automatically fixed during recon-all. You can see how these defects are fixed by loading the files `lh.smoothwm.nofix` and `lh.white` into freeview and toggling between them.

**White matter segmentation errors**, occur in the _volume_ of the anatomical image (not in the reconstructed surface). These will look like the holes shown in the figure in the previous section above, and they are often caused by lesions or gliomas within the white matter. These are relatively uncommon in healthy subjects, and will not be covered in this course.

## Viewing Other Errors

To view other errors, just load the T1-weighted volumes and the remaining white and pial surfaces in `freeview`

```bash
freeview -v [subject]/mri/T1.mgz \\
[subject]/mri/brainmask.mgz \\
-f [subject]/surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=red \\
[subject]/surf/lh.white:edgecolor=yellow \\
[subject]/surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=red \\
[subject]/surf/rh.white:edgecolor=yellow
```

### Identifying Errors

Sometimes what seems like errors are fine. For example

![https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/12_Freeview_Surfaces.png](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/12_Freeview_Surfaces.png)

Here you may notice that some white matter is segmented out of the middle of the surface. If these resolve in the next few slices, it's probably because the white matter slices is being projected in an orthogonal direction to the slice currently looked at. ****In which case no manual editing is required. **Like so**

![https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/12_FailureModes_Slices.png](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/12_FailureModes_Slices.png)

Similarly, surfaces drawn near the medial wall near the ventricles, corpus callous, and subcortical structures are ignored for the final calculations so you can ignore editing them.
