# Glossary
mainly note for myself but if there are any mistakes pls lmk

### Transformation
- Image transformation refers to the process of changing the spatial orientation, scale, intensity, or shape of an image
- In essence, it can be any of or a combination of the three concepts below

### Registration
- Image registration refers to the process of finding the best possible spatial transformation between images when comparing or combining images taken at different times or from different imaging modalities
- It aligns two or more images of the same object or scene so that corresponding points or features in the images coincide i.e. amygdala in patient A is at the same space as the template and patient B
- The goal of registration is to correct for any misalignment or distortion in the images, so that they can be accurately compared or combined
- Registration does not involve any changes to the voxels

### Resampling 
- Resampling refers to the process of changing the resolution and dimensions of the image
- This is often necessary when combining images that have been acquired with different resolutions or different orientations
- Resampling can be done using a variety of techniques - such as [affine transformation](https://pippin.gimp.org/image-processing/chap_resampling.html), non-linear deformation, or warping, to estimate new pixel values in the new grid
- Image transformation is often used to bring an image into a specific coordinate system, such as the Talairach space, or to deform an image to match a template or atlas

### Templates
[Documentation](https://www.lead-dbs.org/about-the-mni-spaces/)
- MNI 305 is used by freesurfer

### Normalisation
- Image normalization refers to the process of scaling the intensity values in an image so that they fall within a specific range or follow a specific distribution.
- This is often done to make images more comparable or to improve their visual appearance
- Normalization can be done using various techniques, such as linear scaling or histogram equalization

# `recon-all` rundown
- [Steps and specific processes](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all#Talairach.28-.3Cno.3Etalairach.29)
- [Specific functions used in recon-all and syntax](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/ReconAllDevTable)
- [Flags for recon-all](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/OtherUsefulFlags)
	- **Flags not mentioned but should be considered**
		- `-parallel` uses up to 4 threads to be used on a participant; and also does coarse parallelisation i.e. (left and right hemispheres run concurrently) 
		- `-openmp` allows for an increase in the threads used for parallelisation  
			- [email exchange](https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg68502.html)
		- `-expert` allows for expert commands to be run and override default caps - refer to the first link 

## **During `recon-all -autorecon1`**  
- `-motioncor`  does motion correction and get it ready for transformation
	- `mri_add_xform_to_header -c transforms/talairach.xfm orig.mgz orig.mgz` will add the talairach.xfm transform matrix to the headers of orig.mgz which is required to map the image to the Talairach space
	
- `-talairach` executes the transformation
	- Affine registration and possibly non-linear deformation on the volume to the **MNI305** using Avi Snyders 4dfp suite of image registration tools
	- This involves automatically **downsampling** and **isometricising** the image to  $1mm^3$  - so beware - [email exchange](https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg22711.html)
	
- `-nuintensitycor` and `-normalization`
	- Just makes the voxels more even in terms of intensity
	- This is important in determining the skullstripping as well as the surface boundaries
	
- `skullstrip`
	- `mri_em_register` performs an affine registration using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algo; apparently it is [known for issues](https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg27057.html) and is **old** - 2009 https://www.lead-dbs.org/about-the-mni-spaces/
	- `mri_watershed` is used for skullstripping and you can set the threshold and re-edit your brainmask if its bad. Refer [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/SkullStripFix_freeview)
	- I had the best result pre-skullstripping with fslbet first and then running the code - also used by [HCP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23668970/) 

May update with 2 and 3 but usually if your brainmask is good, then your segmentations and surface will also be good
