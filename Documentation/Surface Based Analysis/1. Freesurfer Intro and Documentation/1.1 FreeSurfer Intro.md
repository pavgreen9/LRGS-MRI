# FreeSurfer
MRI images consists of 3D voxels. Each voxel contains a number that represent the intensity of said voxel. For T1-weighted images, the number represents the boundary between white, grey, and cerebrospinal fluid.

However, a voxel can encompass two distinct gyri or across multiple structural properties - partial voluming effect. Making it hard to localise activation and structural volume.

FreeSurfer addresses this by tracing around the boundaries of different tissues and transforming these voxels into 2D triangles consisting of vertices and edges which can be viewed in 3D. This is reconstruction.

These can be imaged as a chain link fence wrapped around the surface of the cortex and each vertex contains grey matter structural measurements such as thickness, volume, area, and curvature.

These surfaces can then be further inflated like a balloon to better visualise the gyri and sulci.

FreeSurfer labels these cortex according to two atlases: 
- Desikan-Killiany atlas 
- Destrieux atlas

The labelling of cortexes and subcortical structures is dubbed as parcellation and segmentation respectively. Structural measurements are averaged within each parcellation. These measures can be compared across groups, or correlated with some individual difference measure such as age, IQ, or sex.
