# Recon-all

Recon stands for reconstruction and in FreeSurfer entails all of the necessary pre-processing steps (around 30). The 3D images which consists of voxels are then transformed by recon-all into smooth, continuous, two-dimensional surfaces.

In doing so, it **creates a series of volumes and surfaces from a T1-weighted anatomical image**, and **quantifies the grey matter thickness and volume** in different regions of the brain.

**Requires T1-weighted anatomical image with good contrast.**

### Surface generation

1.  Makes a first pass at white-grey matter boundary for both hemispheres called **lh.orig** and **rh.orig**
2.  Makes a second pass at white-grey matter boundary called **lh.white** and **rh.white**
3.  Boundary is then used as a base from which recon-all extends feelers to search for the edge of the grey matter
4.  Once the edge is reached, the boundary around the outer edges of the grey matter is then made and dubbed **lh.pial** and **rh.pial**
5.  Each one of these datasets can be viewed as a surface, or on the original 3D volume by using [freeview](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FreeSurfer/FS_ShortCourse/FS_06_Freeview.html#fs-06-freeview)

The primary advantage of surface-based representation is its ability to **more accurately measure cortical thickness** as the surface is better defined than voxel-based representations.

By inflating these surfaces into **lh.inflated and rh.inflated**, its **easier to visually identify where the activation maps lie** along the banks of the sulci and ridges of the gyri.

It can then be further inflated to a sphere to more accurately align between major gyral and sulcal landmarks of a template - thus allowing for more accurate parcellation and segmentation.

After the surface based registration, the cortical parcellations of the template are then mapped back to the individual subject and adjusted for individual differences.

The images are parcelled according to the **Desikan-Killiany** or **Destrieux** atlas.
