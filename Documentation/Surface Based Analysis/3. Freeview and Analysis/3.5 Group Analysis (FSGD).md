# Comparing Groups

**Cortical regions** are dubbed as **parcellation**

-   These involve structural measurements in that region for each subject

**Sub-cortical regions** are dubbed as **segmentation**

-   Because these regions are not inflated into a surface, they only contain measurements of grey matter volume and not thickness

When comparing between groups, if vertices are in the common space, then we can calculate the differences in grey matter thickness at a particular vertex and test whether that difference is significant. This generates a statistical map that we can overlay over a brain template `fsaverage`.

## Procedure

Change the `SUBJECTS_DIR` to `wd` again - only applies if we restarted Freesurfer after recon-all

```bash
export SUBJECTS_DIR=`pwd`
```

Create three directories called FSGD, Contrasts and Out which will contain the text files needed to run the analysis

```bash
mkdir FSGD Contrasts Out
```

## Creating the FSGD File

We can specify the variables and covariates of our dataset with a file called `participants.tsv/csv/xslx`

To create a FreeSurfer Group Descriptor (FSGD) file, we will extract those covariates or group labels that we are interested in and format them in a way that FreeSurfer understands.

The FSGD file will both contain the covariates that we want to contrast, and a separate contrast file will indicate which covariates to contrast and which weights to assign to them.

---

Now we have to manually format the `tsv` file

Create a new first column, then type the following four lines:

```bash
GroupDescriptorFile 1
Title socecogrp
Class B40
Class NB40
```

These lines are called **header lines** and indicate the format of the FSGD file

-   The first line, `GroupDescriptorFile 1` indicates that the file is in FSGD format; you will need this first line in any FSGD file that you create.
-   The second line, `Title socecogrp`, will prepend the string “`socecogrp`” to the directories which store the results of your analyses.
-   The next two lines, `Class B40` and `Class NB40` indicate groups next to subject name

The result of which should look like this

```bash
Input	9024	B40
Input	A269	B40
Input	A328	NB40
Input	A334	B40
Input	A338	NB40
Input	A341	B40
Input	A401	NB40
Input	A478	NB40
Input	A495	B40
Input	A574	NB40
```

-   The first column, `Input` signalizes that this row contains a subject
-   The next column, `9024` through `A574` specifies the subject name (which should correspond to the subject directories in the parent folder)
-   The last column, `B40` and `NB40` indicates which group that subject belongs to

Clean up the `.tsv` file into an `.fsgd` file

-   Save the `.tsv` file into a `.txt`
-   Navigate to the `FSGD` with the saved `.txt` file
-   Type this into the terminal (if you did it in excel)

```bash
tr '\\r' '\\n' < participant.txt > participant.fsgd
```

-   This will remove any DOS carriage returns, which Unix cannot interpret, and replaces them with newline characters. This will prevent any errors when using the FSGD file with FreeSurfer commands.

## Creating Contrast File

Our next step is to create a contrast matrix that specifies the **contrast weights** for each regressor in our model

The “Class” variables that we specified in the FSGD file are group regressors: One for the B40 group, and one for the NB40 group

To specify these weights, navigate to the `Contrasts` directory and then type:

```bash
cd Contrasts

echo "1 -1" > NB40-B40.mtx
echo "-1 1" > B40-NB40.mtx
```

This enters the string `1 -1` into a file labeled `NB40-B40.mtx` (`.mtx` stands for “matrix”, as in, “contrast matrix”; in more complicated designs, the contrast file can be any size M x N matrix.)

The label of the contrast file can be anything you choose; in this example, we have chosen a label that is compact and easy to understand.
