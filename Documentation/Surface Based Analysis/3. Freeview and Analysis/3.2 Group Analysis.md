> Before looking at your group analyses, decide on which smoothing kernel you will use - and then stick to it. This will prevent you from checking every possible smoothing size, which in turn will require you to correct for the number of tests that you examine with different smoothing kernels.

# Create a group file with mris_preproc

Combine all individual structural maps into a single dataset - similar to combining consecutive volumes of an fMRI into a dataset and resample to `fsaverage`

We will perform all of these steps with a single command: `mris_preproc`.

Take this code and make it into an executable `runMrisPreproc.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

study=$1

for hemi in lh rh; do
  for smoothing in 10; do
    for meas in volume thickness; do
      mris_preproc --fsgd FSGD/${study}.fsgd \\
        --cache-in ${meas}.fwhm${smoothing}.fsaverage \\
        --target fsaverage \\
        --hemi ${hemi} \\
        --out ${hemi}.${meas}.${study}.${smoothing}.mgh
    done
  done
done
```

The command requires the following arguments:

1.  An FSGD file (indicated by the `-fsgd` option);
2.  A template to resample to (`-target`);
3.  An indication of which hemisphere to resample (`-hemi`);
4.  A label for the output file (`-out`).
5.  `$argv` takes the `fsgd` study name as the argument

The code essentially takes in (for each subject)

1.  Hemisphere
2.  Smoothed kernel from qcache
3.  Volume and thickness (or any output in surf directory)

and concatenates them into an output file

Then run it with

```bash
bash runMrisPreproc.sh socecogrp
```

# Fitting the general linear model with mri_glmfit

Now that all of the subjects are concatenated into a single dataset, we can fit a general linear model with FreeSurferâ€™s `mri_glmfit` command

Take this code and make it into an executable `runGLMs.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

study=$1

for hemi in lh rh; do
  for smoothness in 10; do
    for meas in volume thickness; do
      mri_glmfit \\<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V78jKcqVg7k>
      --y Out/${hemi}.${meas}.${study}.${smoothness}.mgh \\
      --fsgd FSGD/${study}.fsgd \\
      --C Contrasts/B40-NB40.mtx \\
      --C Contrasts/NB40-B40.mtx \\
      --surf fsaverage ${hemi}  \\
      --cortex  \\
      --glmdir Out/${hemi}.${meas}.${study}.${smoothness}.glmdir
    done
  done
done
```

The command will use the following arguments:

1.  Takes the concatenated output from `MrisPreproc` and runs a model at each vertex
2.  `fsgd` clarifies the class for each subject
3.  The contrast files make contrast maps and calculates the significance of contrast at each vertex
4.  The hemisphere of the template to analyze (`-surf`);
5.  A mask to restrict our analysis only to the cortex (`-cortex`);
6.  An output label for the directory containing the results (`-glmdir`).

Run the code with

```bash
bash runGLMs.sh socecogrp
```

## Reviewing the Output

These should be in your directories

```bash
lh.thickness.CannabisStudy.10.glmdir
lh.volume.CannabisStudy.10.glmdir
rh.thickness.CannabisStudy.10.glmdir
rh.volume.CannabisStudy.10.glmdir
```

Navigate to any one of them to find

```bash
beta.mgh  dof.dat   NB40-B40     mri_glmfit.log  rvar.mgh  surface  X.mat
B40-NB40     fwhm.dat  mask.mgh  rstd.mgh        sar1.mgh  Xg.dat   y.fsgd
```

1.  The directories `NB40-B40` and `B40-NB40` contain the contrast data for each contrast specified in `mri_glmfit`
2.  `y.fsgd` is a copy of the FSGD file used to run the analysis
3.  `mri_glmfit.log` contains the code that was run for the current analysis
4.  `mask.mgh` is the mask used for the analysis
5.  `beta.mgh` is a concatenated dataset of the individual beta weights created by the analysis

Within each contrast directory

```bash
C.dat    efficiency.dat  gamma.mgh     maxvox.dat  z.mgh
cnr.mgh  F.mgh           gammavar.mgh  sig.mgh
```

1.  `gamma.mgh` is a contrast map - the beta dataset in the parent directory multiplied by the contrast weights for this particular contrast
    1.  For example, where ref group would have greater volume than exp group
2.  `z.mgh`converts this contrast into a z-map
3.  `sig.mgh`converts the contrast into a map of p-values

You can read descriptions of the other outputs by typing `mri_glmfit` and examining the section under `Command-Line Arguments`

> FreeSurfer uses -log10(p) notation; i.e., a value of 1 in the `sig.mgh`map represents a p-value of 0.1, a value of 2 represents a p-value of 0.01 etc

### Rendering Statistical Map

To render the statistical map on the `fsaverage` template, navigate to the contrast directories

```bash
overf=$SUBJECTS_DIR/Out/rh.thickness.socecogrp.10.glmdir/NB40-B40/sig.mgh
freeview -f $SUBJECTS_DIR/fsaverage/surf/lh.inflated:overlay=$overf
```

This will load the left hemisphere on the `fsaverage` template and map the `sig.mgh` overlay

The threshold `p-value` can be changed by clicking on `configure`
