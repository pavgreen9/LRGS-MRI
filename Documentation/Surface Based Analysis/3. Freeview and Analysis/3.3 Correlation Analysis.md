# Different Onset, Different Slope (DODS) vs. Different Onset, Same Slope (DOSS)

**DODS** will estimate a separate onset (or **intercept**) and a separate slope for each of the covariates in the model

-   More flexible, and also allows you to model interaction effects

**DOSS** restricts the slopes for both covariates to be the same

-   Fewer parameters are estimated, and therefore you will have more degrees of freedom and more statistical power

> DODS is the default for `mri_glmfit`.

If you wish to use DOSS, you would type `doss`as the second argument after mri_glmfit’s `--fsgd`option; e.g., `mri_glmfit --fsgd socecogrp.fsgd doss`

# **Modifying the FSGD File**

Add covariates to the `FSGD` file by adding a `Variable` row below `Class`. Add the variable info in the following columns.

```bash
GroupDescriptorFile 1			
Title socecogrp_age			
Class B40			
Class NB40			
Variables	Age		
Input	9024	B40	71
Input	A269	B40	75
Input	A328	NB40	62
Input	A334	B40	66
Input	A338	NB40	64
Input	A341	B40	65
Input	A401	NB40	62
Input	A478	NB40	70
Input	A495	B40	65
Input	A574	NB40	60
```

Save the `FSGD` as a separate file and remove any carriage returns (if you did it in excel)

```bash
tr '\\r' '\\n' < particpant.txt > {filename}.fsgd
```

Create new contrast files in accordance to the covariates in the new `FSGD`

## eTIV

Another covariate that is useful to include for between-groups analysis is **estimated total intracranial volume**. This will control for overall head size, which can be a confounding factor between groups that on average have different head sizes (e.g., males and females, old and young, patients and control; see [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914007769) for an overview of when it is appropriate to include this covariate).

If a subject has been processed with recon-all, the following line of code will use `mri_segstats` to extract the eTIV (you will need to make sure that this command is run from the directory that contains the subjects, and that SUBJECTS_DIR is pointing to that directory):

```bash
mri_segstats --subject subject_name --etiv-only | grep atlas_icv | awk {print $4}

This number, which usually ranges from about 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 in healthy adults, can then be entered into the FSGD file just as we did with the other numbers. 
Mean-centering the covariates can also change your interpretation of the results; see `this page <http://mumford.fmripower.org/mean_centering/>`__ for examples of when to do it, and how it will change your interpretation.
```

# **Creating Contrast Files for Covariate Analyses**

Depends on DOSS or DODS

### DOSS

This is to control for the effect of age

```bash
echo "1 -1 0" > NB40-B40_Age.mtx
```

For a correlation map for age

```bash
echo "0 0 1" > Age_cor.mtx
```

### DODS

This is to control for the effect of age

```bash
echo "1 -1 0 0" > NB40-B40_Age.mtx
```

For a correlation map for age

```bash
echo "0 0 0.5 0.5" > Age_cor.mtx
```

Change your `[runGLM.sh](<http://runGLM.sh>)` file accordingly

```bash
--C Contrasts/NB40-B40_Age.mtx \\
--C Contrasts/Age_cor.mtx \\
```

### **Sidenote**

The error in the video where I ran

```bash
bash runGLMs.sh socecogrp_age
```

occurred because I hadn’t ran this first

```bash
bash runMrisPreproc.sh scoecogrp_age
```
