# Express
If you know what you want to load, you can make it simpler by doing it from the terminal

```bash
cd /home/pavgreen/Documents/LRGS/MRI/Participants/PS/A698 # Change sub accordingly

freeview -v mri/aseg.mgz:colormap=LUT mri/T1.mgz mri/brainmask.mgz mri/wm.mgz -f surf/rh.inflated surf/lh.inflated surf/rh.white:edgecolor=yellow surf/lh.white:edgecolor=yellow surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=red surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=red
```

1.  The `-v` option signalizes that the following files are volumes
2.  The `-f` option signalizes the the following file is a surface
3.  The colons indicate an option for the file they are attached to; for example
    -   `aseg.mgz:colormap=LU` means to assign a look-up table colormap to the aseg.mgz file
    -   Likewise, the `edgecolor=yellow` option means to set the edgecolor for the lh.pial file to yellow
    -   Other options for freeview can be found by typing `freeview -h`from the command line

# Freeview In Detail

Freeview is a dataviewer that allows you to look up and load anatomical or functional images

## Looking at the files

The first 5 directories in each of the output will be the one used the most

```bash
cd PS

ls 9024
```

You should get an output like this

```bash
label  mri  scripts  stats  surf  tmp  touch  trash
```

The first five files are the ones you will use the most

To look at each directory more specifically

```bash
ls *insert filename*
```

---

## Directory

### Label

-   The label directory contains labels which can also be thought of as ROI - contains atlas of subjects

### MRI

-   Contains volumes e.g. intensity normalised brain, skullstripped brain, and subcortical segmentations

### Scripts

-   Contains record of everything during recon-all (use to check for errors during recon-all and re-implement preprocessing steps)

### Stats

-   Contains structural measurements such as thickness and volume for each parcellation and segmentation

### Surf

-   The surf directory contains surfaces e.g. pial and inflated

---

## Control Panel

The images are ranked in a hierarchy - with the top most image covering all other images.

### Toolbar

Opacity allows you to change its transparency to view images directly underneath it

LUT colour segments the brain areas according to a predefined table

---

## Loading Volumes and Surfaces

To load a surface, click `File -> Load Surface`, and select an image in the `surf`directory, such as `lh.pial`

-   This will overlay a 3D representation of the surface in the three-dimensional box of the View window, and will trace the outline of the surface in the orthogonal boxes (i.e., the sagittal, axial, and coronal views).
    
-   The color of the surface in the orthogonal views can be changed by selecting a new `Edge color`

In our case, we want to first

-   `File -> Load Volume` and navigate to the `MRI` directory to load
    -   `T1.mgz` - intensity normalised anatomical image
    -   `aseg.mgz` - segmentation of grey matter, white matter, and subcortical structures
    -   `wm.mgz` - white matter
    -   `brainmask.mgz` - brain no skull
-   `File -> Load Surface` and navigate to the `Murf` directory to load
    -   `rh.pial` and `lh.pial` - surface covering whole grey matter
    -   `rh.white` and `lh.white` - surface covering whole white matter
    -   `rh.inflated` and `lh.inflated` - inflated brain
-   Either drag the slices to update the orthogonal panels or simply use up-down arrow on the panels to update the slice
